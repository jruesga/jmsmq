This library is intended to create a package of Java classes, based on JNI,
to access to Microsoft Message Queuing Server 3.0 interface. This library
offers support to the next actions:

  · Message Queueing Server´s Actions: as create new queue, destroy existing
  queues, enumerate queues, search existing queues, ..., for private and 
  public queues (including transactional and no transactional queues)

  · Queue´s Actions: as recover queue properties information

  · Message Queue´s Actions: as receive, peek and send message (with UTF-8
  and UNICODE auto discover), and purge queue (including transactional and 
  no transactional message)

The library recreates the MSMQ library, an has a representacion of MQQueueInfo
(as a factory), MSMQQueue and MSMQMessage on Java classes, that it simplifies
the use of the library.
